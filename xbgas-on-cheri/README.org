#+TITLE: Towards xBGAS on CHERI: Examining the Benefits of a Secure Distributed Architecture

* Course Overview
This two-week course explores the integration of the Extended Base Global Address Space (xBGAS) Runtime with CHERI-enabled ARM Morello platforms. It focuses on adapting xBGAS to work seamlessly with CHERI's hardware-enforced bounds and capabilities while leveraging a universal threading model using pthreads and thread pooling techniques.

* Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1. Understand the concepts of capabilities-based security and the global address space programming model.
2. Explain the benefits and challenges of integrating xBGAS with CHERI-enabled platforms.
3. Implement thread pooling techniques using pthreads for architecture-independent runtime simulation.
4. Evaluate the performance gains and overhead reductions achieved through cross-platform adaptations.

* Course Outline
** Week 1: Introduction to xBGAS and CHERI
   - Overview of the Extended Base Global Address Space (xBGAS) Runtime
   - Introduction to CHERI and capabilities-based security
   - Exploring the benefits of integrating xBGAS with CHERI-enabled ARM Morello platforms

** Week 2: Adapting xBGAS for CHERI Compatibility
   - Transitioning from platform-specific mechanisms to a universal threading model
   - Implementing thread pooling techniques using pthreads
   - Evaluating performance gains and overhead reductions
   - Discussing future research opportunities in hybrid memory systems on capability hardware

* Code Examples
** ~xbgas_cheri_threading.c~
#+BEGIN_SRC c
// Example code demonstrating thread pooling using pthreads for xBGAS on CHERI
#include <pthread.h>

void *worker_thread(void *arg) {
    // Thread pool worker implementation
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread_pool[NUM_THREADS];
    
    // Create thread pool
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_create(&thread_pool[i], NULL, worker_thread, NULL);
    }
    
    // Wait for threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(thread_pool[i], NULL);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
