** Prompts 

#+begin_quote
Create and name a two week course (lc + dashes) for a session summary I'll provide after you confirm we're ready to proceed. Assume we're going to populate {dir name}/README.org so show the course in a code block for org-mode. Suggest any code that would be relevant. Suggest questions the student should be able to answer at the end of the course. All code examples should induced a suggested filename to save to the directory.

Ensure the directory name is on a single line, in a code block, and the end of the chat without prefix to simplify cut and paste.

Rename the title of the chat once I've given the session.
