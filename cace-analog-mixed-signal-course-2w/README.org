* CACE Analog/Mixed-Signal Design Flow

This two-week course covers the open source analog and mixed-signal design flow using the CACE system.

** Topics
- Introduction to open source PDKs and tools 
- Overview of the CACE design flow
- Specifying circuit performance requirements
- Simulating over PVT corners with ngspice
- Generating datasheets with performance metrics
- Laying out analog circuits with magic
- Integrating analog blocks into larger mixed-signal designs
- Case studies and examples

** Suggested Exercises
- Specify and simulate a basic opamp design
- Generate a performance report for the opamp
- Create a layout for the opamp 
- Integrate the opamp into a mixed-signal design
- Analyze the impact of PVT variations

** Questions
- What are the key components of the CACE design flow?
- How does CACE help with specifying analog performance?  
- What tools are used for simulation and layout in this flow?
- How can you verify an analog design across PVT corners?
- What are best practices for analog circuit layout?
