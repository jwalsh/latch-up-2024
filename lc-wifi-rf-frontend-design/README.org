# RF Front-end Receiver Design for 2.4GHz/5GHz WiFi Application

This course covers the design of an RF front-end receiver for 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi applications using open-source tools and the Skywater PDK.

## Week 1: RF Front-end Receiver Design

- Understand the components of an RF front-end receiver (LNA, Mixer, VCO)
- Design and simulate an RF front-end receiver for 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi applications
- Achieve dual gain mode (5dB/30dB) and optimize noise figure and IIP3 performance

## Week 2: Tape-out and Testing

- Prepare the RF front-end receiver design for tape-out using efabless open-source tools and Skywater PDK
- Understand the tape-out process and requirements
- Plan for testing and characterization of the fabricated chip
